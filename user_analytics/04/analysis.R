library(shiny.telemetry)

# Let's load the data and answer some research questions!
# 1. How many sessions were run? Is it in line with your expectations for this app (are there too few sessions, too many)?
# 2. Which point size was used most often? Do users like the default value?
# 3. Which plot type is used most often?
# 4. Can you notice differences between those results and results from exercise 03?
# Spin up the `shiny.telemetry::analytics_app(data_storage)` to see what info it provides.
