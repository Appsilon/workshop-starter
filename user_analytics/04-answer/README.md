# shiny.telemetry

> The shiny.telemetry R package tracks events occurring on a user session, such as input changes and session duration, and stores them in a local or remote database.

> It provides developers with the tools to help understand how users interact with Shiny dashboards and answer questions such as: which tabs/pages are more often visited, which inputs users are changing, what is the average length of a session, etc.
