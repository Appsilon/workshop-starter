# Deriving insigts from logs.

In this exercise we will use a log file to analyze user behavior.

The `analysis.R` script contains logs from running an app.

Answer the following questions:
1. How many sessions were run? Is it in line with your expectations for this app (are there too few sessions, too many)?
2. Which point size was used most often? Do users like the default value?
3. Which plot type is used most often?
