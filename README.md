Welcome to the workshop repository! Here you'll find the code which we will use during the hands-on sessions.

Please complete the following steps before the workshop to ensure you are ready to work on the assignments:

## Getting started

1. Make sure you are running R version 4.3.1 or higher (In RStudio choose Tools, Global Settings)
   ![Version](readme-assets/version.png)

2. Download the current repo to get started. You can use your favorite git management tool, or if using RStudio choose File, New Project, Version Control, from Git.

   ![download](readme-assets/download.png)

3. Install all required packages. This repository is using `renv` so it should be as simple as running `renv::restore()` from your console

   ![restore](readme-assets/restore.png)

4. After restoring you should be able to run the existing `app.R` application.
